  - `$fetch` and `useFetch` on steroids

  - Supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 (including advanced features like [discriminators](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#discriminator-object))
  - Uses runtime-free types that outperform old-school codegen
  - Autoimports schemas from YAML or JSON, locally or remotely
  - Works with Nuxt [Layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers)
