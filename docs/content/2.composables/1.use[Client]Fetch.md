description: "Generated fetch composable"

Composables are generated for each OpenAPI client specified in the `openFetch` section of Nuxt config and provide a convenient wrapper around `useFetch`. 

It has the same API as Nuxt's [useFetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch) composable with additional `path` option, which is used to replace params in the pathname.

```vue twoslash
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await usePetsFetch('/pet/{petId}', {
  path: {
    petId: 12
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ data?.name }}</h1>
</template>
```
